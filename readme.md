# Simple dashboard implementation with EJS, Express, PostgreSQL, and Sequelize

Make sure you `remove all the tables` if you use full REST API version or vice versa! (just to make sure everything went butter)

### Installation

Require [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and PostgreSQL to run.

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

### Database connection

Make sure to edit **config.json** file located in /config folder. Server need to connect to database "belajar" on postgreSQL

### Additional notes

- Dashboard login is hardcoded using admin:admin as a credentials 😆
- Only user dashboard working in this version 🙏
